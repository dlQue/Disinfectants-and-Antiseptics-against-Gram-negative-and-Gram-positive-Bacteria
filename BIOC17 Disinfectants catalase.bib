  abstract = {Catalase is an important antioxidant enzyme that dismutates hydrogen peroxide into water and molecular oxygen. The catalase gene has all the characteristics of a housekeeping gene (no TATA box, no initiator element sequence, high GC content in promoter) and a core promoter that is highly conserved among species. We demonstrate in this review that within this core promoter, the presence of DNA binding sites for transcription factors, such as NF-Y and Sp1, plays an essential role in the positive regulation of catalase expression. Additional transcription factors, such as FoxO3a, are also involved in this regulatory process. There is strong evidence that the protein Akt/PKB in the PI3K signaling pathway plays a major role in the expression of catalase by modulating the activity of FoxO3a. Over the past decade, other transcription factors (PPARγ, Oct-1, etc.), as well as genetic, epigenetic, and posttranscriptional processes, have emerged as crucial contributors to the regulation of catalase expression. Altered expression levels of catalase have been reported in cancer tissues compared to their normal counterparts. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that regulate catalase expression could, therefore, be of crucial importance for the future development of pro-oxidant cancer chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Killing of Escherichia coli by hydrogen peroxide proceeds by two modes. Mode one killing appears to be due to DNA damage, has a maximum near 1 to 3 mM H2O2, and requires active metabolism during exposure. Mode two killing is due to uncharacterized damage, occurs in the absence of metabolism, and exhibits a classical multiple-order dose-response curve up to at least 50 mM H2O2 (J. A. Imlay and S. Linn, J. Bacteriol. 166:519-527, 1986). H2O2 induces the SOS response in proportion to the degree of killing by the mode one pathway, i.e., induction is maximal after exposure to 1 to 3 mM H2O2. Mutant strains that cannot induce the SOS regulon are hypersensitive to peroxide. Analysis of the sensitivities of mutants that are deficient in individual SOS-regulated functions suggested that the SOS-mediated protection is due to the enhanced synthesis of recA protein, which is rate limiting for recombinational DNA repair. Specifically, strains wholly blocked in both SOS induction and DNA recombination were no more sensitive than mutants that are blocked in only one of these two functions, and strains carrying mutations in uvrA, -B, -C, or -D, sfiA, umuC or -D, ssb, or dinA, -B, -D, -F, -G, -H, -I, or -J were not abnormally sensitive to killing by H2O2. After exposure to H2O2, mutagenesis and filamentation also occurred with the dose response characteristic of SOS induction and mode one killing, but these responses were not dependent on the lexA-regulated umuC mutagenesis or sfiA filamentation functions, respectively. Exposure of E. coli to H2O2 also resulted in the induction of functions under control of the oxyR regulon that enhance the scavenging of active oxygen species, thereby reducing the sensitivity to H2O2. Catalase levels increased 10-fold during this induction, and katE katG mutants, which totally lack catalase, while not abnormally sensitive to killing by H2O2 in the naive state, did not exhibit the induced protective response. Protection equal to that observed during oxyR induction could be achieved by the addition of catalase to cultures of naive cells in an amount equivalent to that induced by the oxyR response. Thus, the induction of catalase is necessary and sufficient for the observed oxyR-directed resistance to killing by H2O2. Although superoxide dismutase appeared to be uninvolved in this enhanced protective response, sodA sodB mutants, which totally lack superoxide dismutase, were especially sensitive to mode one killing by H2O2 in the naive state. gshB mutants, which lack glutathione, were not abnormally sensitive to killing by H2O2.},

Mass transfer rate coefficients were used to determine the impact of water chemistry and common bleach disinfection rinses on the removal and inactivation of the pathogen. Attachment mass transfer rate coefficients generally increased with ionic strength. Detachment mass transfer rate coefficients were nearly the same in KCl and AGW rinses; however, the detachment phase lasted longer in KCl than AGW (18~±~4~min and 4~±~2~min, respectively), indicating that the ions present during attachment play a significant role in the cells' ability to remain attached. Specifically, increasing bleach rinse concentration by two orders of magnitude was found to increase the detachment mass transfer rate coefficient by 20 times (from 5.7~±~0.7~×~10−11~m/s to 112.1~±~26.8~×~10−11~m/s for 10~ppb and 1000~ppb, respectively), and up to 88 ±~4\% of attached cells remained alive.

Most of these active agents demonstrate broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity; however, little is known about the mode of action of these agents in comparison to antibiotics. This review considers what is known about the mode of action and spectrum of activity of antiseptics and disinfectants. The widespread use of these products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular whether antibiotic resistance is induced by antiseptics or disinfectants. Known mechanisms of microbial resistance (both intrinsic and acquired) to biocides are reviewed, with emphasis on the clinical implications of these reports.},

  abstract = {The 'respiratory burst' of phagocytes such as neutrophils generates superoxide which forms H2O2 by dismutation. H2O2 and Cl- ions serve as substrates for the enzyme myeloperoxidase to generate hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is thought to play an important role in bacterial killing, but its mechanism of action is not well characterized. Furthermore, although many studies in vitro have shown HOCl to be a damaging oxidant with little or no specificity (particularly at high concentrations), bacteria which have been ingested by phagocytes appear to experience a rapid and selective inhibition of cell division. Bacterial membrane disruption, protein degradation, and inhibition of protein synthesis, do not seem to occur in the early phases of phagocyte action. We have now found that low concentrations of HOCl exert a rapid and selective inhibition of bacterial growth and cell division, which can be blocked by taurine or amino acids. Only 20 microM-HOCl was required for 50\% inhibition of bacterial growth (5 x 10(8) Escherichia coli/ml), and 50 microM-HOCl completely inhibited cell division (colony formation). These effects were apparent within 5 min of HOCl exposure, and were not reversed by extensive washings. DNA synthesis (incorporation of [3H]-thymidine) was significantly affected by even a 1 min exposure to 50 microM-HOCl, and decreased by as much as 96\% after 5 min. In contrast, bacterial membrane disruption and extensive protein degradation/fragmentation (release of acid-soluble counts from [3H]leucine-labelled cells) were not observed at concentrations below 5 mM-HOCl. Protein synthesis (incorporation of [3H]leucine) was only inhibited by 10-30\% following 5 min exposure to 50 microM-HOCl, although longer exposure produced more marked reductions (80\% after 30 min). Neutrophils deficient in myeloperoxidase cannot convert H2O2 to HOCl, yet can kill bacteria. We have found that H2O2 is only 6\% as effective as HOCl in inhibiting E. coli growth and cell division (0.34 mM-H2O2 required for 50\% inhibition of colony formation), and taurine or amino acids do not block this effect. Our results are consistent with a rapid and selective inhibition of bacterial cell division by HOCl in phagocytes. H2O2 may substitute for HOCl in myeloperoxidase deficiency, but by a different mechanism and at a greater metabolic cost.},

However through the times this senile enzyme has continued to intrigue the scientists by surprising facts and phenomena, such as peculiar interweaving of subunits and remarkable thermal stability. It is also known for suicide inactivation by its own substrate. Catalase is known to be implicated in various medical scenarios and its levels have served as a marker in that capacity. It has even been incorporated into several pharmaceuticals. This review strives to clarify these perspectives. It also draws attention to the biophysical contributions offered by thermodynamics and kinetics in these discoveries.

Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but are surrounded by layers of peptidoglycan many times thicker than is found in the Gram-negatives. Threading through these layers of peptidoglycan are long anionic polymers, called teichoic acids.

The extent of germination is dependent upon the concentration of alcohol present in the germinating medium. This inhibition is reversible since removal of the alcohol from the spore environment allows germination to proceed.},
